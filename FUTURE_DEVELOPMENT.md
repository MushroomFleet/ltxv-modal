# Future Development for LTXV-Modal API

This document outlines potential enhancements and additional features that could be implemented in future versions of the LTXV-Modal API.

## Planned Features

### Advanced Video Generation Capabilities

1. **Video Extension**
   - Implementation of video continuation (extending a video forward or backward)
   - Support for seamless transitions between original video and generated extension
   - API endpoints for both forward and backward extension

2. **Keyframe-Based Animation**
   - Support for multiple keyframes at specific points in timeline
   - Interpolation between keyframes with configurable settings
   - UI integration for keyframe placement and editing

3. **Style Transfer and Control**
   - Video-to-video style transfer using reference videos
   - Fine-grained control over style strength and features
   - Support for mixing multiple styles

### Infrastructure Improvements

1. **Model Optimization**
   - Support for quantized models (8-bit, 4-bit) for faster inference
   - Memory optimization techniques for longer videos
   - Offloading strategies for larger batch processing

2. **Caching and Performance**
   - Implement TeaCache support for faster inference
   - Add pre-computing of text embeddings
   - Support for progressive generation with previews

3. **Scaling and Availability**
   - Multi-region deployment options
   - Queue management for heavy workloads
   - Auto-scaling policies based on demand

### User Experience

1. **Web Interface**
   - Simple web UI for video generation
   - Interactive parameter controls
   - Result gallery and history

2. **CLI Improvements**
   - Progress indicators during generation
   - Local configuration profiles
   - Better error messages and recovery suggestions

3. **Output Formats and Processing**
   - Support for GIF and WebM formats
   - Post-processing options (upscaling, frame interpolation)
   - Video stabilization

## Technical Research Areas

### Model Extensions

1. **LoRA Fine-tuning Integration**
   - Support for custom LoRA adapters
   - API for on-the-fly adapter loading
   - Adapter blending capabilities

2. **Pipeline Customization**
   - Pluggable components (schedulers, VAEs)
   - Custom conditioning mechanisms
   - Integration with other models as components

### Integration with Other Tools

1. **ComfyUI Integration**
   - Deeper integration with ComfyUI-LTXTricks
   - Support for workflow import/export
   - Custom node configurations

2. **API Ecosystem**
   - OAuth support for third-party integrations
   - Webhooks for completion notifications
   - SDK packages for common languages

## Implementation Priority

The implementation priority for these features is:

1. **High Priority (Next Release)**
   - Video extension capabilities
   - Performance optimizations for longer videos
   - Improved error handling and recovery

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Keyframe-based animation
   - TeaCache integration
   - CLI improvements

3. **Future Considerations**
   - Web UI development
   - LoRA integration
   - Advanced output processing
